\section{Conclusion}

The Voice Activity Detector (VAD) project successfully reached the desired goals, detecting and responding to voice activity and send information with MQTT, even though it was not able to integrate all functions simultaneously due to lack of processing power. 

With Home Assistant, Grafana and GUI this project delivered a versatile user interaction methods to deliver a comprehensive voice-activated control solution.

The analog front end proved effective in detecting audio peaks within the human voice frequency range, ensuring reliable wake-up signals for the microcontroller. An important addition to the AFE was a potentiometer that regulates the microphone gain, this allowed for quicker testing and made for more modular system. Another really important aspect of the AFE was the use of multiple feedback in the filter, making the filter more robust to component variations.
